### Explanation

* Zone Name: corresponds to the area name where the model belongs, in this case is `dt_01` since the whole map is divided in zones, this can be changed to use the author's name instead.
* Object Name: corresponds to the object name, in this case is one of the numerous buildings in the zone, this one represents `building4`.
* Misc Name: Corresponds to the miscellaneous name, which can be almost anything, in this context is utilized to tell that model is emissive. So, you can use it to describe something about your model, such as size, features, functionality and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your model names must be descriptive and avoid using any generic terms or extremely short names.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
There's no strict order, as long as it makes sense.
{% endhint %}

#### The following shows some examples of what you should do and what you should avoid.
